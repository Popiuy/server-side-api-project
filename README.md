# Ignorance is Bliss: A Site About Doomscrolling

## Description

This is a simple site that will give you two very distinct forms of content - current news,
or pictures of cats. <br>

Our goal is to help people notice the effect that consuming content has on their mood and
wellbeing. Being an informed citizen is a stressful task in 2023, and we want to help people
find their balance.<br>

## Usage

Visit https://popiuy.github.io/server-side-api-project/ and choose your path. 
You can switch paths any time with the buttons at the top of the screen. <br>

The webpage will track the amount of time you spend on news versus cats. After a while, 
take note of how you feel compared to the proportions of time you've spent on each page. <br>

## CSS Framework
For this site, we used [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/grid.html). 
Made by Google, Materialize is similar to Bootstrap. It can be imported via CDN,
and then used by assigning predetermined classes to HTML tags.
It operates with a similar 12-columngrid system, and is 
inherently responsive to varying screen sizes:
